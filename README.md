orthocheck

This program checks some already constructed orthgroups
All genes in each gene family are blasted against each species and the results recorded
The results are parsed so that families are only kept if they contain genes from > 50% of species, whose genes all match each other when blasted against that genome or proteome.
I call this an All v All reciprocal best hits method
It is in early days
